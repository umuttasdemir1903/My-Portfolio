        TS, B, JIRA, Git/ Github, Figma, Agile, Unit Testing,API, SCSS, AWS,
        Jenkins, Firebase, MVC, MVVM and React I strive to create interactive
        and engaging experiences for users. Moreover, I place great importance
        on continuous learning, keeping up with evolving technology trends. I am
        collaborative, possess problem-solving skills, and am dedicated to
        completing projects on time and with quality. I would love to contribute
